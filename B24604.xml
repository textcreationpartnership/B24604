            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>In <hi>St. Martins Court</hi> in St. <hi>Martins-lane,</hi> at the sign of the <hi>Golden Heart,</hi> up one pair of Stairs, Liveth</p>
            <p>A Gentlewoman, who, by the long Experience of her Predecessors, as likewise from her own Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice for several Years past, hath attained to great Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in things relating to the Female Sex, which she is unwilling to conceal, knowing them far to exceed any thing exposed by the common Pretenders of this Town: Therefore is persuaded, by several Persons of Quality, to make this general Publication.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. She hath a most incomparable <hi>Wash</hi> beautifie the <hi>Face,</hi> agreeable to all manner of <hi>Complexions,</hi> the Virtues of it are so great, that it takes off Sunburns, Yellowness, Morphew, Redness, Pimples, Freckles, or what else may obstruct a fair and lovely Complexion; it smooths and plumps the Skin, and makes the Aged appear youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to a wonder, and leaves such an agreeable Lustre, that the most curious Eye cannot perceive Art to be used, but will judge it to be the true product of Nature.</item>
               <item>2. She has a most delicate <hi>Pomatum,</hi> which is prepared to answer the same with the <hi>wash,</hi> and is wonderfully agreeable to be used with it; and she dares presume to say, that whoever shall make use of both these, shall in a little time find such an Alteration in their Complexions, that they themselves shall stand amazed. A Summers day is too short to demonstrate the full Virtues of both these, therefore for brevity's sake she omits it, and leaves those that make a tryal to speak their Praise.</item>
               <item>3. She hath red and white <hi>Handkerchiefs.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>4. She hath a fine <hi>Lip-Salve.</hi>

               <item>5. She hath all sorts of delicate <hi>Pearl-Powders</hi> to whiten the Skin.</item>
               <item>6. She hath most curious <hi>Masks</hi> and <hi>Forehead-cloths,</hi> which take out all Spots, Pits or Scars caused by the Small-Pox; and also all Wrinckles in the Forehead.</item>
               <pb facs="tcp:196230:2"/>
               <item>7 She hath a rare <hi>Dentifrice Powder</hi> and <hi>water</hi> for the Teeth, which will make them as White as Ivory. The Water is an infallible Remedy for the Scurvy in the Gums, and preserves from all Scorbutical Humours.</item>
               <item>8. She shapeth the Eye-brows, taking off the uneven Hair, and making them perfectly beautiful. <hi>She</hi> likewise maketh low Foreheads high, and cuts Hair if required. <hi>She</hi> hath also a great <hi>Secret</hi> to prevent Hair from fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, causing it to grow where it is wanting.</item>
               <item>9. She hath a fine <hi>Ointment</hi> to anoint the Face so soon as the <hi>Small-Pox</hi> begins to dry, which certainly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents all <hi>Scars</hi> and Pits</item>
               <item>10. <hi>She</hi> hath a <hi>water</hi> highly approved and often ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced for the Cure of <hi>sore Eyes,</hi> cold or hot <hi>Rheums,</hi> whether caused by the Small-pox, or any other way.</item>
               <item>11. <hi>She</hi> hath an incomparable <hi>Pill,</hi> which cureth the Scurvy, with all its symptoms, altho' never so bad, and left off as incurable by others; the Dropsie, yellow-Jaundice, cold and phlegmatick stomachs; opens all Obstructions purges the Head, adds a good Colour to the Face, purifies &amp; sweetens the whole Mass of Blood, creates a good stomach, and makes the Body able to withstand Diseases; it is a prevailing Medicine in the Green-sickness: In short, the Virtues of this Pill are too many to be incerted here.</item>
               <item>12. <hi>She</hi> hath a <hi>Golden Ʋnction,</hi> which cures all old Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, altho in the Legs, and perfectly heals them, altho of never so many Years standing. It likewise cures all Scabs or Spots, Ring-worms or Itch, Scald Heads, or any breakings-out of either Head or Body, and answers the Patients Expectation to a wonder.</item>
               <item>13. <hi>She</hi> hath an excellent <hi>Powder</hi> which kills and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroys all sorts of Worms in Men, Women, &amp; Children, and brings them forth in great Numbers.</item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <hi>She</hi> has also a great <hi>Secret</hi> to prevent Miscarriages in Women, which hath been proved with <hi>wonderful</hi> success.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>She</hi> hath likewise Medicines to cure Barrenness in Women, the like no Person hath but her self.</p>
            <p>Her Hours are from 8 till 12, and from 2 till 8 at Night.</p>
